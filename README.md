# README

This repo is for developing test routines for [F12-XG implementation](https://github.com/ak-ustutt/molpro/issues/1) in Molpro

## Scripts
`gen_input.py` : Generates molpro input files for various ansatzes and codebases (writes to `outputs/`)

`analyze_outputs.py` : Analyzes outputs generated from generated input files above.

## Reference files (!!Need to add!!)

`neon_df-hf_df-mp2-f12_aug-cc-pVDZ.*.{xml, out}`

These files are from older dates (before F12-devel was implemented) and can be used for reference.
